Part III
When I call moveDown twice the figure moves down
If I call make.Invisible the figure goes invisible
To move the circle 70 pixels to the left I need to use "-70"
When I put a color that is not known the figure goes black
When I don't put the quotes there is an error
I'll send the picture of the green circle
Create a circle,make it visivle, then made it green, found the right diameter, move it left or right and up or down.
Create another circle, made it visible, then made it yellow (representes the sun), found a smaller diameter than the green on, then move it right or left and up or down.
Create a person, Made it visble, found the right height and width, move it up,left,right and down. (same thing for person2 but way smaller.


Part IV
I will send the picture of the sun being blue and adding 2 suns

How to add 2 suns? Changed the sun1 color to blue by doing sun1.changeColor("blue");
Had to put private Circle sun2; after private Circle sun;
Had to add sun2.+ the method Ex. sun2.moveUp(); etc..

For the sunset I need to do this,
 } public void sunset() {
        sun.slowMoveVertical(300);
        sun.moveVertical(-300);
        drawn = true ;
    }
